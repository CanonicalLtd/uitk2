    \brief Provides the palette of colors from the theme that widgets use to draw themselves.

    Palette provides access to colors defined by the current theme. The actual
    color palette to use depends on the state of the widget being drawn.

    A color palette (\l PaletteValues) has various roles to choose from depending
    on what part of the widget is being drawn (the base of the widget, the
    foreground, etc.).

    For each color there is a corresponding 'text' color that is guaranteed to
    provide good legibility for text or icons placed on top of a background
    of the corresponding color.

    Example of a Text on top of a background Rectangle:
    \qml
    Item {
        Rectangle {
            color: theme.palette.normal.base
        }

        Text {
            color: theme.palette.normal.baseText
        }
    }
    \endqml
