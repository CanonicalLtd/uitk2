 * \inqmlmodule Ubuntu.Components
 * \ingroup ubuntu
 * \brief Singleton defining standard Ubuntu durations and easing for animations
 *        that should be used to ensure that Ubuntu applications are consistent
 *        in their animations.
 *
 * Example of use:
 *
 * \qml
 * RotationAnimation {
 *    duration: UbuntuAnimation.SlowDuration
 *    easing: UbuntuAnimation.StandardEasing
 * }
 * \endqml
 *
 * Animation durations should be selected depending on the frequency and
 * disruptiveness of the animation. The more frequent an animation is, the
 * faster it should be. The more disruptive an animation is, the slower it should
 * be. Rule of thumb to select durations:
 *  \list
 *   \li SnapDuration: very frequent, non-disruptive.
 *   \li FastDuration: frequent, non-disruptive.
 *   \li SlowDuration: less frequent, non-disruptive.
 *   \li SleepyDuration: disruptive.
 *  \endlist
 *
 * Note that \l UbuntuNumberAnimation provides a standard NumberAnimation for
 * Ubuntu applications.

/*!
 * \qmlproperty QEasingCurve UbuntuAnimation::StandardEasingReverse
 *
 * StandardEasingReverse is mainly used in combination with StandardEasing.
 * For example, if animating an object that bounces, you will want the object
 * to slow down as it reaches the apex of its bounce and slowly speed back up
 * as it descends.
 *
 * StandardEasingReverse should not be used to introduce a new object or screen
 * to the user.
 * In general, it should only be used if StandardEasing is visually inappropriate
 * and even so, will usually be proceeded by StandardEasing.
